1. Start by placing some carpet (red where you'll place armor stand later)
2. type `/trigger JoinStandOff` for both player
3. Place your armor stand by pressing [sneak] & [jumping] on a red carpet
4. once you're done (with the same number of armor stand in both side) click on the `Next Step` in the chat, or type `/trigger NextStep`
5. As soon you've finished your game, you're ready for a new game at step 1
